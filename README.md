Actigraphy module

Opening .csv files, filtering and convolution, splitting to days with curve fitting before.   
Main result: estimates of fitting parameters with their errors.

Actigraphy module is the result of my work on Bachelor Thesis. It was written in order to make an analysis of the actigraphic data of patients with disorders of consciousness.
My goal was to analyze circadian rhythmicity on the basis of patient's amount of movement. In order to perform it, I used a cosinor rhythmometry analysis, i.e. fitting a one-period sinusoidal curve to 24 hours of data, and getting estimates of MESOR, amplitude and phase shift as a result.
